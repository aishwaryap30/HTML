  <p id="text1" style="color: white;">Hello It's Me <b>AISHWARYA PANDEY</b>. This portfolio best describes my skills and interest.</p>
  <p id="text2" style="color: white;"> I was born and raised in [Khandwa/India], and I am currently a college Student. During my high school years, I
    took an interest in Computer Science. In fact, I continuously took classes in this subject area
    because I wanted to challenge myself and learn more. In addition, I have gained skills such as problem-solving, time
    management, and leadership from extracurricular activities. I value
    these skills because I strongly believe they will help me be successful in my academic.
  

    I used my time management skills to also work on my hobbies and interests. Some of my hobbies include dancing, exploring things/places, adventures. <br>
<br>
    I want to mention that creativity and critical thinking are two of my greatest strengths, which I can use both in
    real life as well in professional or academic settings.
    
    Up until now, they have been a great help to my
    accomplishments. One weakness Iâ€™d like to mention is flexibility*. I need some time to adjust to abrupt changes in
    plans. However, I am working hard to turn this weakness into a strength, by exposing myself to situations where I
    need to adapt quickly.
    

    I am thrilled to continue my academic interests at RGPV University. I am also certain that my skills, enthusiasm,
    and work ethic will make me a strong candidate.
