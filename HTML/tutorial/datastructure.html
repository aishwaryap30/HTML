<h1 id="cd"><i>WHAT IS DATA STRUCTURE</i></h1>
<p><b>Data structures</b> are essential components that help organize and store data efficiently in computer memory. They provide a way to manage and manipulate data effectively, enabling faster access, insertion, and deletion operations. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs , each serving specific purposes based on the requirements of the problem at hand. Understanding data structures is fundamental for designing efficient algorithms and optimizing software performance.</p>

<h1><i>Data Structure</i></h1>

<p>Data structures are essential components that help organize and store data efficiently in computer memory. They provide a way to manage and manipulate data effectively, enabling faster access, insertion, and deletion operations. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs , each serving specific purposes based on the requirements of the problem at hand. Understanding data structures is fundamental for designing efficient algorithms and optimizing software performance.<br>

A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. Different basic and advanced types of data structures are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge of data structures. <br>

Data structures are an integral part of computers used for the arrangement of data in memory. They are essential and responsible for organizing, processing, accessing, and storing data efficiently. But this is not all. Various types of data structures have their characteristics, features, applications, advantages, and disadvantages. So how do you identify a data structure that is suitable for a particular task? What is meant by the term ‘Data Structure’? How many types of data structures are there and what are they used for?<br>

The choice of a good data structure makes it possible to perform a variety of critical operations effectively. An efficient data structure also uses minimum memory space and execution time to process the structure. A data structure is not only used for organising the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge of data structures.<br></p>

<h4><i>Array:</i></h4>
An array is a collection of data items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array). <br>

<h4><i>Linked List</i></h4>
Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers. <br>


<h4><i>Stack</i></h4>
Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). In stack, all insertion and deletion are permitted at only one end of the list.<br>


<h4><i>Queue</i></h4>
Like Stack, Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). In the queue, items are inserted at one end and deleted from the other end. A good example of the queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added. <br>

<p id="ab">he DSA course helped me a lot in clearing the interview rounds. It was really very helpful in setting a strong foundation for my problem-solving skills. Really a great investment, the passion Sandeep sir has towards DSA/teaching is what made the huge difference." - Gaurav | Placed at Amazon
