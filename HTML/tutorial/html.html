<h1><i>What is HTML?</i></h1>
<p1>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and design web pages on the internet. It was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 at CERN, initially as a simple markup language. After, it evolved through versions from HTML 2.0 to HTML5 (the latest 2024 version).<br>
